	<h2>Pre-College Life</h2>
		<p> In high school, I continued to play tennis and train hard to hopefully play at the varsity level in college. I also developed a love for computers and technology which was reflected in some classes I took on IT in high school. I tried to learn about topics like networking, system administration, and how data centers work. Finally, I applied for a internship at the New York Internet company as a data center technician. I worked there for a while installing and testing switches and servers in the data center. Every so often I got to go into the network operations center and learn from the senior systems administrators how they did their jobs. </p>
		<p>After getting through with my SATs, I began applying to various colleges with the University of Rochester being a top pick of mine. After finding out that I got accepted to the school, and was recruited to the varsity tennis team, I hastily accepted the opportunity and began studying at the school soon after graduating from high school. The summer before going to college I was lucky enough to travel to some countries in Africa, mainly Morocco, and experience the rich and diverse culture there. At first I wanted to pursue a computer science degree but it was tough to manage between varsity tennis, and my new found decision to join NROTC with aspirations of becoming a Marine Corps Officer.</p>

	<h2>Focus of Study</h2>
		<p>Major in History, Minor in Computer Science.</p>

	<h2>College Life</h2>
		<p>Given that, I switched to a more manageable major, being history, that more aligned with my military career aspirations while also giving me the freedom to pursue computer science as a minor. I ultimately put being on the tennis team on hold during my sophomore year in order to devote more time to military training. During my time at the University of Rochester I naturally taken many history courses that required lots of reading assignments and essay writings but were otherwise very intellectually rich and enjoyable.  In the beginning of my sophomore year I decided that I wanted to minor in computer science rather than major in it as I originally planned. My first computer science course was CSC 170 intro to web development where I learned how to make websites using html, css, php, jquery, and java script. I was fairly successful in the course and hope to continue to expand my knowledge of web development technologies in the advanced course on front end web development during my sophomore year. </p>
