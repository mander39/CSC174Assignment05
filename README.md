## Assignment 5
- 2/22/19
- Odd Student Out: Two Students are from the same country, and the third is from a different country, making her the odd student out.
### Domain
The Domain of this assignment are the three classmates, who of which share home countries and one of which is from a different country.
### Triples to define the Ontology
- Each student has had their home country
- Each student has had their home town within that country 
- Each student has a major/minor
- Each student has written about their lives before college
- Each student has written about their lives while at the University
- Each student has had their extra-curricular activities
### Taxonomy Explanation
The information will be divided into headings and have their information displayed chronologically
### Choreography Explanation
I have arranged the topics in order of which would have come first in their lives. It starts at their home country, because that is the thing that makes one student the odd one out. It then goes to hometown, precollege experience, current college experience, and ends off with the extra curriculars they've done in college

### Slider Notes - Michael 
To change the images go into the slider.inc file. 
The code didnt come with any documentation, so look for these (ctrl+F) varibles in the source code (jssor.slider) to adjust the behavior:
- $PauseOnHover = on by default (slideshow pauses on mouseover)
- $AutoPlayInterval = 3 seconds by default, I changed it to 6 seconds since 3 seemed too fast. 
- The "sections" with just country name in them should probably be h4s, w3c validator is throwing errors at those
