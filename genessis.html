		<h2>Pre-College Life</h2>
		<p> 
			Before coming to the University of Rochester, I attended Canyon High School in California where I was involved in various extracurricular such as: Student Government, National Honor Society, English National Honor Society, Spirit Club, Chemistry Club, and a few others. I even founded a chapter of the Science National Honor Society at my school and at the time I believed I wanted to major in Chemistry.
		</p>
		<h2>Focus of Study</h2>
		<p>Major in Business, Minor in Computer Science and Spanish.</p>
		<h2>College Life</h2>
		<p>
			Since starting college, I have held 3 jobs during the academic term. My first ever job at UR was at the Common Market where I worked for about a year and a half before deciding that I wanted a change. I applied to the Greene Center where I now work as a Front Desk/Administrative Assistant. I really enjoy working at the Greene Center because I am not only able to help people discover resources available to them on campus, but I also am able to develop my professional skills throughout this role. I also am currently working on a startup called BarterOut, which is a textbook exchange platform for students by students, as a Marketing Analyst.
